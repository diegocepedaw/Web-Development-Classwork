PART 1 and 3

For these parts of the lab I chose to organize my html document using tables. 
Although usually using tables is not the best of ideas, the nature of the information 
I was trying to mark up (a table of somgs, artists, albums, etc.) meant that tables were
actually a logical choice. To create semantic meanining I used header tags for the headers in 
the table giving the highest hierchical importance to the elements that outline what the content of 
the table is. Bold and italics tags also help to give importance to some table elements like 
the artist and album. 

Part 2

I chose to structure my xml markup in a playlist that contains songs, then, to those songs I assign 
all the relevant information (title, artist, album, release, genre, website, and cover).The reasonng 
behind this organisation. This organization also lends itself to be easily marked up in either
a tabular format or a list like the one in part 4.

Part 4

Basically same structure as part two but marked up and with the additiof some html tagsto incorporate
horizontal lines and images.
